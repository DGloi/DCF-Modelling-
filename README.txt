# DCF-Modelling-

Welcome on my first published programm on this GitHUB.
With this repository, I've tried to propose a classic Dcf Model for company valuation as we know it with python.
But, with the strong hypothesis that this model involves, it seemed to me assumptions given in a classic dcf model could use variations.
Hence the use of normal distributions on assumptions values. The data involved in the scripts are merely suggestion and only serves as a exemple.
To be found here two script classic DCF model and its results in excel  and Monte Carlo simulation and the result of the simulation in a picture normal distribution graph.
